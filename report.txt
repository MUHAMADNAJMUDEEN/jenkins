jenkins
	I have downloaded the jenkins war file.
	I have created a dummy job in jenkins.
Dummy
	In dummy job I automated one java program.
	Instead of running java program using command prompt I have given those 
commands to the jenkins.
	After adding file to the workspace, Its working as expected.

Schedule
	I scheduled the whole project to run every minute & thats 
working as expected.

building two projects
 	The project base is to build automation whenever the file 1 has 
succesfully build. 
	After the completion of first project build then dummy has to 
be build.

Github Automation
	Installing git plugin in jenkins
	git repository
